# Dependency Injection in ASP.NET MVC

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. ASP.NET MVC provides built-in support for DI, allowing you to inject dependencies into controllers and other components.

## Why Use Dependency Injection?

- **Reduces Tight Coupling:** Improves maintainability and scalability by decoupling dependencies.
- **Improves Testability:** Makes unit testing easier by allowing mock implementations of dependencies.
- **Centralized Configuration:** Dependencies can be configured in one place, improving manageability.

## Steps to Implement Dependency Injection in ASP.NET MVC

1. **Install a Dependency Injection Framework**
   ASP.NET MVC does not have a built-in DI container. Popular DI frameworks include:
   - **Unity**
   - **Autofac**
   - **Ninject**
   - **Castle Windsor**

2. **Install the Package**
   Use NuGet Package Manager to install your preferred DI framework.
   ```bash
   Install-Package Unity.Mvc
   ```

3. **Create Interfaces and Implementations**
   Define the interfaces and their concrete implementations.
   ```csharp
   public interface IProductService
   {
       List<string> GetProducts();
   }

   public class ProductService : IProductService
   {
       public List<string> GetProducts()
       {
           return new List<string> { "Product1", "Product2", "Product3" };
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Configure the DI Container**
   Register your dependencies in the `UnityConfig` or equivalent file.
   ```csharp
   public static class UnityConfig
   {
       public static void RegisterComponents()
       {
           var container = new UnityContainer();

           // Register dependencies
           container.RegisterType<IProductService, ProductService>();

           // Set Dependency Resolver
           DependencyResolver.SetResolver(new UnityDependencyResolver(container));
       }
   }
   ```

   Call `UnityConfig.RegisterComponents()` in the `Application_Start()` method in `Global.asax.cs`.
   ```csharp
   protected void Application_Start()
   {
       UnityConfig.RegisterComponents();
       AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();
       RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
   }
   ```

5. **Inject Dependencies into Controllers**
   Use constructor injection to inject dependencies into controllers.
   ```csharp
   public class HomeController : Controller
   {
       private readonly IProductService _productService;

       public HomeController(IProductService productService)
       {
           _productService = productService;
       }

       public ActionResult Index()
       {
           var products = _productService.GetProducts();
           return View(products);
       }
   }
   ```
